## Observations

* My mentor noticed that the timetable had a number of rows that repeated themselves in respect of the 
  of the opening times of the gym. In addition, I also inserted a square box around the fee amount so it would stand out. This
  was done the advice of my mentor. I also increased the font zise in the timetable and the features section in line with 
  my mentor's observations. 

* I tried to add a specific location on the map for the gym. I signed up for an API key with Google but when the link was copied
over it did not work. I discussed this with my mento and we were unable to solve.

* I had a bug in relation to using bootstrap "table-center". It was creating a wide margin on the
mobile version of the website. I removed the bootstrap code which fixed the margin.
